## ü§ñ AI Evolution

### Problem Solved
- **Before**: Passive AI (0 projectiles, collision kills only)
- **After**: Active AI (shoots projectiles, intentional kills)

### Improved Reward System
- +15 points for projectile kills
- 0 points for collision kills
- +0.5 points per projectile fired
- -0.1 points for inactivity
- Position-based rewards (center vs edges)

### Reward System Details
- **Edge Penalties**: -1.0 to -0.2 points when too close to screen edges
- **Center Bonus**: +0.3 points for staying away from edges
- **Progressive Center Bonus**: Up to +0.2 additional points for optimal positioning

## üéØ Results
- ‚úÖ AI transformed from passive to active behavior
- ‚úÖ 0.3 projectiles average (vs 0 before)
- ‚úÖ 38% improvement confirmed
- ‚úÖ Enhanced spatial awareness with position-based rewards

## üß† AI Technical Details

### Observation Space (12 dimensions)
- Player position (x, y)
- Player health and XP
- Player level
- Closest enemy positions and health
- Second closest enemy position
- Enemy count and survival time

### Action Space (5 continuous actions)
- Movement direction (x, y): [-1, 1]
- Attack direction (x, y): [-1, 1]
- Attack decision: [0, 1]

### Training Algorithm
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** via Stable-Baselines3
- **Multi-environment training** for better generalization
- **TensorBoard logging** for performance monitoring

## üèÜ Performance Metrics
- **Survival Time**: Steps survived before death
- **Active Kills**: Enemies killed with projectiles (+15 pts each)
- **Passive Kills**: Enemies killed by collision (0 pts)
- **Projectiles Fired**: Measure of AI activity
- **Spatial Positioning**: Distance from edges and center
- **Total Reward**: Cumulative score during episode

## üîß Development Notes
- **Reinforcement Learning**: PPO algorithm with custom reward shaping
- **Reward Engineering**: Carefully balanced to encourage active play
- **Position Awareness**: New system to prevent edge-hugging behavior
- **Gymnasium Integration**: Standard RL environment interface
- **Real-time Visualization**: Both training metrics and gameplay demo
- **Effects System**: Particle-based visual effects with procedural audio
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal FPS impact with smart particle management

## üéÜ Effects System

The game features a comprehensive visual and audio effects system. See [EFFECTS_SYSTEM.md](EFFECTS_SYSTEM.md) for full documentation.

### Visual Effects
- **Particle System**: Dynamic particles with gravity, velocity, and life
- **Card Selection Effects**: Unique effects for each rarity (Common ‚Üí Legendary)
- **Upgrade Effects**: Visual feedback for each stat boost
- **Combat Effects**: Projectile firing, impacts, and enemy deaths
- **Level Up**: Spectacular multi-layered effect with screen shake

### Audio System
- **Procedural Generation**: All sounds generated algorithmically
- **Frequency-based Design**: Each card rarity has a unique frequency
- **Dynamic Mixing**: Automatic volume balancing
- **Combat Sounds**: Laser shots, impacts, and explosions
- **No External Files**: Fully self-contained audio system

Test the effects interactively:
```bash
python tools/testing/test_effects_demo.py
```
